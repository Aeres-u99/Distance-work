Okay here this folder will contain my nano projects which will be somewhat connected with Mathematical things,though they might be simple and all
I am simply uploading them for kinda safe keeping and ofcourse its easier to ask for "How I can improvise my coding skill?" by directly giving
People my code so yep here we go

-----------------------HAPPY NUMBERS---------------------
A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its
digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not 
include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).

[Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm]
Well its kinda tricky for me to understand but still I will try my best to talk about it here
It goes like this, in a straight line race a fast bike will never encounter a slow bike , i.e once the race begins the faster bike will
see slower bike directly at the end of line.
The same is not the case in case of a circular track, rather the faster bike will complete 'cycle/s' before slower one just completes 
one revolution.So the thing is in case of a loop in a situation( or a loop in linked list as well) we take two pointers a slow paced one
and a fast paced one, eventually compare their values if they are equal it means there is a cycle and we can simply use that scenario 
to skip out of infinite loop :D
Thats what I have understood and tried to apply
